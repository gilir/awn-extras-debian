Hi!

Those looking for Dbus-based plugins for their favourite application, please
go to the awn-plugins folder. 

Applets are under awn-applets. awn-core-applets are those that ship alongside
awn, such as the trash, separator etc. Each applet has its own folder, and you
just need to enter it and do the usual:

./autogen.sh && make && sudo make install

unless otherwise stated :-)!
