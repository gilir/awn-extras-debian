    Corrected issue with parsing the interface list

03/13/2010:
    applied patch from bug #534061 to fix color selection bug in preferences caused by not calling 'to_string()' in the returned gtk.gdk.Color object https://launchpad.net/bugs/534061
    

01/05/2010:
    PEP8 cleanup of all lines > 80 chars
    Rename of classes/variables for space/consistency
    Change of timer values for consistent drawing.
    Removed some unused modules.
    Removed 'blank.png' - initial icon is now created with gtk.gdk.pixbuf_new_from_xpm_data()

01/03/2010:
    Removed settings.load/load_preferences
    Fix for applet/font-sizing when changing orientation
    Changed instantiation of color objects to use gtk.gdk.color_parse instead of gtk.gdk.Color('#XXX') for older systems
    Changed handling of default preferences/unassigned keys
    

01/02/2010:
    Fixed bug which caused the unit of measure checkbutton to become out of sync with the gconf value
    Changed default interface to '', was wlan0 for some reason..
    PEP8 verified - mostly complaint, a few lines are "too long"
    Replaced icon
    Removed LICENSE file - provided by AWN
    Fixed desktop file version
    Removed "Encoding" from desktop file
    Improved logic for setting device preference values per Mark Lee's suggestion
    Added timeout_add_seconds wrapper function
    Adjusted width calculation if orientation is vertical
    Change version string to use awn.extras.__version__
    Changed email address

12/20/2009:
    Change logic to graph calculation which corrects the following rendering issues -
        Graph lines drawing outside of border/frame
        Graph normalised top-value was rendering off-screen when applet size smaller than 35
        Graph normalised top-value was rendering very low on the graph when applet size greater than 60
    Changed scaling of initial icon - it was rendering too large and centered text was displayed with an odd alignment to the dock
    Fixed some issues with default values
    Changed short-name to 'bandwidth-monitor' to match schema file
    Corrected path to UI file
    Fixed division by zero error
    Addedd bandwidth-monitor.ui and bwmprefs.py to Makefile.am

12/19/2009:
    Added preferences to control -
        Enable/Disable drawing of the background
        Enable/Disable drawing of the border
        Select color/opacity of background
        Select color/opacity of border
        Options to control the text representation of throughput
            Display Upload/Download text
            Display Sum text only
            Do not display text - only draw the graph.
        Enable/Disable drawing the zero value in the graph (if true, draw a line at the bottom of the graph for zero value)

12/18/2009:
    Cleaned up code to make it run faster or use less resources
    Removed everything related to the status of interfaces (Not required, may add later)
    Removed everything related to IP Addresses for interfaces (Not required, may add later)

12/16/2009:
    Added call to applet.errors.general if read access to /proc/net/dev fails.
    Made changes to TODO file
    Change parser logic for to handle interfaces with less than 11 columns of output in 'netstat -iea'    

12/14/2009:
    Created preferences dialog to manage options -
        An option to select the unit Bytes/bits
        A spinbutton entry for setting the minimum threshold
        A "Devices" pref-pane which allows selection of interfaces into virtual interfaces
        A color picker for upload and download colors for use in the line-graph.
    Fixed division by zero that would occur in some scenarios.

12/10/2009:
    Added virtual interfaces for SUM and MULTI
        The Sum Interface is a virtual interface which displays the sum throughput of all interfaces that are selected for "Sum"
        The Multi Interface is a virtual interface which displays each individual throughput of the interfaces that are selected for "Multi", each with the colors defined for the interface.
    Added logic to parse and use preferences that are planned

11/29/2009:
    Changed table generation function to be less verbose
    Fixed regular expression for gathering IP/Netmask
    Changed IP/Netmask tooltip logic
    Changed command for device stats gathering to include administratively down-interfaces

11/28/2009:
    pep8 verified main program file
    Added a few non-parsed comments to the source file

11/28/2009:
    Changed initial ratio value to 1 to prevent the graphs from ignoring data transfers below 3200 bytes
    Changed the graph scaling to display the line graph almost center of the graph window below 6400 bytes
    Added items to the TODO list

11/27/2009:
    Filter out the wmaster0 interface.
    Applied patch from onox:
        Renamed some classes
