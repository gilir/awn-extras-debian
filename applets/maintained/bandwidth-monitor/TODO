TODO:

--- Things that need to happen ---
None Left...

--- Things I would like ---
Add preference control for applying effect to text (new default = True, always apply)
Auto select interface (maybe based on default route)
Add toggle for enable/disable auto-scaling (so 100Mbps would draw the line at the top of the meter)

--- Completed TODO's ---
Create preference dialog for selecting the color of the line-graphs, as well as the background
    Done
Ability to select multiple (or all) devices for a sum throughput -
    Done (also created 'multi' interface)
Add preference for specifying minimum threshold for charting data
    Done
